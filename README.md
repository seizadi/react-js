# ReactJS

## Summary
This repo has a number of ReactJS applications that
I developed taking the
[Modern React with Redux [2020 Update]](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/).

This course was thaught by 
[Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/).

I found the course very helpful as a starting point.

## Deployment

There are a number projects under here each its own
standalone ReactJS application. They each have their
own README and specific detail as needed.

Here I capture detail about deploying any ReactJS
application, using the videos application as a
sample.

### Deploy using [Vercel](vercel.com)
